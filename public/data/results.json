And today we have a very, very special guest. Gentleman who's joining us today. He is an actor. He's a very famous villain. He has a podcast. He does stand-up comedy. He makes vlogs. And now he's also launching his music career by launching a rap song. Take the mic in your hand. There's stand-up along with it. At least do some comedy. But Sam's rap? It is none other than rapper OP, Mr. Ashish Vidyarthi. Sir, welcome to the channel. Sir, I just want to ask you, you know, most people, they have a midlife crisis, sir. But I don't know what to call this. This is last, last, end-life crisis. What is going on? This is my afterlife party. I feel bad for all the other 60-year-olds in this building. Because like, how am I 60 years old and still living next to a Sharmaji ka beta? Like, all my wives are like, Dekho, dekho Ashish ko. Sir, you have done 200 movies. Sir, 350. 350 movies in over 12-13 languages. So, let me tell you Tanmay, I have done 350 movies and I have died in 11 languages. Yes, that's it. So, sir, please tell us how do you die in Telugu? Yes. And I used to tell people that for years, whenever people go for narration, I used to go to listen to my cremation. How did I die? I'm assuming, sir, for example, when Kullu leaves the road, people see him and say, Hey, Bhopal! They shout like this. I'm assuming, if people recognize you, what would you shout? I'm assuming, Vithal Kanya will definitely be there. Hey, Ashutosh Rana. Can I please confirm? I was with Ashish Hussain. Roshan is going to collaborate. Every time someone comes to take a photo with him, first question sir asks is, what is my name? Okay, I'm going to take a photo with Roshan. First question sir asks is, what is my name? And the responses to that are amazing. In the airport, I heard Ashutosh Rana. I heard Mukesh Rishi.",

Kaustubh, your internet is a little bad. So, in today's episode, you make a joke. Mom, look at the heat. Oh, ambulance, ambulance. It's a dark room. Is it oddly relatable? Not that much. The doctor said, you're late. That's really... Very good, Kaustubh. Very good. After Mumble Rap, we have Mumble Comedy. Too good. I'm gonna have a little tea. Comedy is like a rival is hiding behind the router. Mom, look down. He's sitting in the server room. Kaustubh, you should've learnt sign language. Tell me something, guys.

I couldn't come to the Rhodes audition, but here, finally. Kullu doesn't stay in Rhodes. Sir, I'm telling you, I haven't dreamt of anything more than what I saw in the Rhodes audition. But your vibe is more like split swilla. I've always wondered why people would want to come to a Rhodes audition when I was taking it. I'm from the generation of Devarshi bhai. If I ask someone for a pen, if I meet that person after two years, I'll remember that he asked me for a pen. She is a legend, bro. She's the ultimate legend. We reacted to one of Devarshi's clips, one of the episodes. Then he messaged me on Instagram saying, really appreciate that even today, you remember. And I said, no bhai, you asked me for a pen. We are live on members only. And of course, the first question that somebody has asked is, is this Raghu or Rajeev? Yo, yo, yo, welcome to another very, very special episode. It's special for a bunch of reasons. Let's begin. We have Bank Aurobi in the house, Writer Aurobi in the house, Prisoner Aurobi in the house, Manager Aurobi in the house. Making his return to the reaction episode is Shohar Aurobi aka Vishal Diyama. Vishal, welcome back. As soon as KL Rahul gets injured, Vishal Diyama decides to return back into the world. And of course, 10 years from that epic day of the AIB roast, the one, the only, the man, the myth, the legend, Raghuram returns to a platform with me and Rohan, proving once again that any platform where Indians need to humiliate themselves, Raghuram will be there. Raghuram, welcome to the show. How are you doing, brother? Thanks, man. It's been 10 years since that? It's been 10 years, yeah. Close to 10 years.",

This girl will never become the Prime Minister. She will. Hi! Hi! Hi! She is on the phone. The bride doesn't even know where the camera is. What have you done? Uncle, put it on. Uncle, your hand is hurting. Hey! Hey! Hey! Why are you doing this? They are doing this so that they don't reach. This is a fun game.

Have you seen this video, Nishant? No. This is Dhoni's friend. Oh, yes. Dhoni's friend. I think Dhoni must have come to Ranchi to play the game. And he must be hanging out with Dhoni's friends after the game the next day. And before the flight left, they must have gone out to play cricket. And Dhoni's friend, without showing any respect, is considered to be India's number one player. Wicketkeeper, batsman, number one. And people are pulling his leg by putting a camera on him while watching the video. Tell me something. You were supposed to say something in this. Mahi, you're looking so smart. Why is there a lot of here? This is the beauty of friendship. I think this is the beauty of male friendship. If our friend looks smart, it's important to abuse him. Because it's weird to just compliment him. I won't say, Nishant, you're so funny. You're so hilarious. Because I won't believe it till then.

Please give it up for Kumar Varun, Ashish Shakya, and Dua Saab. Welcome, friends. Today's first prank, guys. Apparently, a kid has pranked a CBSE result. Let's begin. No, Papa! Papa, no! You must be thinking, why is the vlog starting all of a sudden? So, actually, I was just coming back from the institute. In the institute, there was a ruckus. What a ruckus! Everyone was like, the result is here, the result is here. What happened? I failed because of YouTube. It's nothing like that. Your brother has already passed. I'm going to call my younger brother at home. Did you come back from school? Yes. Okay, do one thing. Papa pranks me that I've failed. He puts a camera on his computer side. Now I've told him to set all the cameras at home by himself. That's how much he helps me, my younger brother. And he also does my editing and all. What does he do then? He brings a cup and a pan. That's his biggest contribution. It's just a game. My papa is a little short-tempered. So, it's possible that his shoes and slippers will fall. Knives and swords can also come out. You know, this is their version. Which we say, guys, we're in for a very good show today. It's going to be a lot of fun today. Knives and swords can come out. Papa is short-tempered. So, just wear your seatbelts. It's going to be a fun ride. Papa is short-tempered. Papa is short-tempered. Oh my God! Rahul, his papa might be Sidhu Ghoosewala. I was trying. If he punches, it's Ghoosewala. Ghoosewala. Sorry. Yes, Vichodri. What's the result? The result? Wow! It's not right. I've been studying all day. What happened? It's not right. Why is it not right?

And I haven't even touched it yet. I don't know why. I think, for so long, in my head, I've been building it up. Like, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it. Then it became this whole gag. And now that it's come, it almost feels like, what's the big deal? And I've been trying to think of why. I think, I haven't opened it yet because once I open it, and once you see it, it's like a clear symbol of hard work. And in that moment, I'll have to appreciate myself. And that feels weird. I can't self-praise myself. And YouTube play button is literally a congratulatory symbol. Say, you did well. I think, I've been trained since childhood that I can never think of a sentence like, you did well. Always, you can do better. You should do better. So, I haven't opened it yet. I think, when your entire self-worth is in work, whenever there's a good work or a milestone, then your brain starts telling you, don't celebrate. Move on to the next thing. And you have to work. You don't deserve happiness. That's why I've decided that today's whole day is marked out only to celebrate. Alright, Bot Army, let's check out our golden play button. Gather around, children. Let's unbox. Please do the honours. Happy one million year. Happy play button to you. Goodbye, Instagram engagement. This thing is finally here. Now, nobody will care about what you post on Instagram. Yay! It'll be very funny if YouTube is like... YouTube will be like, you made a fool out of me. Will that be funny? Do you think that'll be funny? I don't know. You tell. It will be funny. Do you think that'll be funny? Navik, do you think that's funny? Alright, guys.

And now they're officially together. Married with children. Wow. Sarthak and Ritika, may you live long. May you have two kids. Is this for real? Yes, bro. Yes, look. This is sexy.

Oh, it was directed by somebody. No, no, I was asked to get a haircut. Oh, I see. Mom got angry. That's what I managed to do. Like, Kullu weeping at the barber's. I was like, cut some more. Bro, it's fun when a barber cuts hair near the ears. When they use that little drrrr on the neck, man, it feels good. I've been alone for so long. Like, with a head massage machine. Listen, dude, I'm very scared of getting an enema for this reason. Yeah, what if you really like it? What if I enjoy it? This is why I'm looking forward to my first prostate exam. Now at this age, I want to learn if there are any new paths for me to walk. Has anyone done an enema here? At some point, after we throw Kullu out, it can technically be called an enema. If it gives you pleasure, then I have a plan. What's going on, Kushagra? What's the latest? Enema, liked it, loved it, going back again. Why does it feel like you're in an OYO room? I think when a TV is mounted on a wall like that, it automatically feels like an OYO room. I feel like someone will come in a towel. Welcome to another episode. What was I saying in the beginning?

By the way, Sumit has his own YouTube channel, he vlogs, you guys should check it out. The link is in the description. The first surprise was for a very sweet boy called Chetan. A couple of months ago, Ather reached out to me asking me if I wanted to do something with them. And I put up a story on my Instagram saying, anybody who wants to give somebody a bike, this is Chetan's story. My mom was already weak, since childhood. Because of that, there was a lot of tension. Next month, the American recession started. Because of that, my dad lost his job. My mom's health used to get serious at any time. That was our lowest point. That's when we opened a stationary shop. So, the house and shop were very far away. So, we used the same bike for that too. So, the shop used to run, sometimes less, sometimes more. And the cost of the hospital was also very high. In 2017, my mom passed away. And because of the hospital, there was a lot of debt. Even now, we use that bike to go to the office. It's very old. It's been 17 years. Actually, my Instagram has been shut down for 1-1.5 years. So, the day I reactivated it, my first story was for them. Anyone who wants to give a new bike to someone, please send me an email.",

Okay, so suppose you bought something for 500 bucks, you get 2% return of pop coins. Now each pop coin is worth 1 rupee. And you can burn these pop coins on buying actual D2C products. Like you can buy from Soul Store, Red Wolf, Perfumes. You can actually spend pop coins on that. Got it? Enjoyable, yes. As a model, I like this. Tell the pop coin sellers to give it directly to the brand, why are they giving it to us? You'll spend it on your favourite brand, they won't design it for you. Golu, the fundamental feature of capitalism is that you choose where to waste your money. Yes, okay. I want to give an offer to the pop UPI sellers. I want you to gift me something according to my monthly UPI. But you have UPI now. You need a buffer interface. Sir, I'm in Dubai. Kullu, which building should I get you to build? Someone said, guys Rohan is starting to look like his cat. And for everybody who's watching, just make your first UPI transaction on Pop and you'll get 50 pop coins. And by the way, I'm going to be giving away pop coins on today's episode. So you guys better be funny, okay? Based on your jokes, I'll give you pop coins. Oh, you want to give it to us too? Yes, I'm giving it.",

    "whisperTranscription": "Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to another episode. Guys, today's episode is very special for two reasons. First of all, India is through to the finals of the T20 World Cup. We are feeling excellent. Speaking of cricket, we have two IPL winners here with us on the show today. Please give it up for Venky Iyer and Nitesh Radha. Whoo! Welcome, friends. How are you both feeling after winning the IPL and coming on our show? Clearly, you're having a bad time. I'm enjoying it. I'm very happy. I've been watching your show on memes. Nitesh bhai, they've made a lot of fun of me. I've seen it. Is that so? Congratulations, you guys played an amazing season. I must say that watching you... It was very obvious that you were the strongest and you were going to win. So, tell me, did you guys know you were going to win the IPL this year? What was the feeling in the dressing room? The feeling in the dressing room was 100% that we were going to win. I don't know why, but there was a vibe in the dressing room this year. And there was a belief. The speech on the first day was in the mind of every player. And maybe we were working towards that. So, I won't say it so easily, but we got the success this year. We got it very easily, sir. Perfect. You know that, right? Tell me something, guys. What is more difficult to read? Sunil Narayan's bowling or Gautam Gambhir's expression? Mitesh will tell you. Neither of them. It's difficult to read the mood of wives. Recently, after doing a podcast, I got scolded at home. Why didn't they take my name? Before this started, I told them to take my name first. After doing beer biceps, everyone has to get scolded a little. Tell me, when you guys won the IPL, I just want to know what happened that night. What did you guys do? How did you guys celebrate? How much lemon and soda is there? You don't even have to tell me that. It's my first time winning a major championship. So, it was a very special moment for me.",

Kullu, you are doing shows also. I'm doing a show in Dubai, 7th July. Wow, what a crazy international. Kullu, tell me one thing. One day when you were in Bhopal, when you were a kid, did you ever imagine that one day you would become a bad comedian? 7th July, Dubai. Also, if you're wondering how I'm getting 2 videos in a week, it's because we have a sponsor. Mostly people come to me to attract students, but today's sponsor is different. Today's episode is brought to you by Unacademy Stars. If you want to become an educator, this is the best platform for you to do so. If you want to be an Unacademy Star, there's an application process, you have to apply. After 3 rounds of selection, 50-60 of you will be selected in the final cohort. You will be taken to Bangalore for a 12-week training program, where industry experts, content creators, and top educators will mentor you. You have a fixed compensation of 10 lakhs per annum to 25 lakhs per annum. All this and more details later on in the episode. Let's start. There's no such thing in Tanmay Reacts anymore. Yes, correct. That thing is such a vague concept. There's no such thing in Haji Ali Juice Centre anymore. What's that thing? Tell me. This is like, dad used to say, there's no such thing in this year's Diwali. Dear viewer, maybe you have lost your innocence. There's no such thing in you. There's no such thing in you. If you drink daily for 6 months, there's no such thing in you. Maybe the whole thing was the friends we made along the way.",

Yes, you heard it right. I love you. Don't take me wrong. In what sense I love you? I'm not the guy who is going to cut his hand if you don't love him. Or I'm not the guy who is going to divorce his wife just to be with you. Or I'm not the guy who want to just fall here into this dump if you don't love him. My love is something different. I just want to point out that first he said the location is as beautiful as you and then he said I would fall in this dump. Your RCB jersey is looking very nice. He said, we have Kullu, he is Lullu. But it's good that he described the three arch types of lovers. Guy who will cut hand, guy who will not divorce his wife and guy who will fall in dump.

It is hackathon season once again. The Solana Renaissance Hackathon is around the corner and this time the best projects and developers stand a chance to win up to half a million dollars in prize money. And there's $150,000 in prize money for all the sidetracks as well. This includes Deepin, payments, consumer apps, gaming, infrastructure, and all the selected winners get accepted into the Colosseum Accelerator where you get a $250,000 check along with mentorship from other Web3 founders. If you have a killer startup idea, this is your special chance. And if you don't have an idea and you're looking for an idea, go to build.superteam.fun. 200 plus ideas on what you can potentially build at the hackathon, all right there. Or if you're just looking to join a team that's participating in the hackathon, you can do that as well. Join Colosseum, use their team finder. Over a thousand Indian developers have already joined it. So you can find a team there. Or if you have a team and you have an idea and you're looking to build, check out Superteam India on Twitter. They're doing in real life build stations across the country so you can meet other people who are participating in the hackathon and get whatever help you need. By the way, this time, especially for India, ONDC has a special track. ONDC is basically UPI but for e-commerce. And they wanna find startups that can increase order volume on the network. So maybe you can build an interoperable product like an ads exchange, a negotiation engine, coupon system, there's $10,000 in additional prizes for all submissions to the ONDC track. Previous winners of this hackathon have gone on to raise about $600 million in funding. So what are you waiting for?

    "whisperTranscription": "Alright, welcome to the new vlog. So as you guys know, for a couple of years I was staying in Bangalore. I was working there, I was losing some weight. And just in general, I just wanted to get away from Mumbai for a bit. And whenever I would visit Mumbai from Bangalore, you know, either for work or just because I'm missing some of my friends, it was becoming very painful because I was bunking at Naveed's house and Naveed was living very far away. So I told Naveed, let's shift to a place where we are close to friends, close to comedy clubs, close to work. So a couple of months ago, we started house hunting and we got so lucky because this house was spacious, it was the perfect price, we had a very sweet landlady. It was very close to Ashu and Akash's house, Rohan's house, comedy clubs. There was a gym close by, which is what I wanted. But as you guys know, moving into a new house is a whole process and a half. Sometimes it doesn't have furniture, sometimes it has furniture, but it's not to your liking. And me and Naveed had our own furniture, but it was like from very long ago. It was like from a decade ago. And it was time for a reshuffle. So the first week, me, Naveed and Naseef moved in. Rohan and Ashu came to check out the house. This is how it went. Hi! Welcome to my family! Oh my God! Congratulations guys! Congratulations on your house. Congratulations! Hello! Wow! Isn't it crazy that you came inside my house with the mic? I always when I come to meet you, I have mic and camera ready. Like I know a vlog can start anytime. I will give you a tour of the house. Oh! Jhula! Excuse me! Sir, please. I am Gujarati. This is called Hitchco. Hitchco is where all schemes against Bahu are made. Hitchco is the official scheming chair of Gujju household. But I feel like you can jazz it up a bit. Like what? Right now it feels like I am in a BDSM room, you know. This is very metallic. How does she know? Guys! You told me. This I like guys. What do you like? Like books. It's the same thing from the previous house.",

One of my favourite guilty pleasures is, Following these like Bollywood trade accounts that tweet out box office figures. Because they have the best replies. Okay, all these Bollywood actor fan clubs, They're always warring with each other. And they always have the dumbest memes. Like they will keep putting like, Oh, Akshay Kumar released a movie, It didn't perform at the box office. But then Shah Rukh came and he had the biggest box office success of all time.

This year, I made a lot of strides on personal life, health front and professionally, I did a lot of fun new things. And a lot of people asked me this year saying, Tanmay, do you think you'll continue vlogging for your whole life and continue reacting to memes? And they asked me this question, I think in the hope that I'll say, no, no, no, it's not for my whole life. But I have to say, 2020 when I started and at the end of 2023, I'm still having as much fun. I still look forward to getting on a Zoom call with my friends and watching memes and making jokes. I still get as excited about uploading a video. I still read every comment you guys leave, every Instagram message you guys drop. I read all of it and so does the rest of the OG gang. So thank you guys for still keeping this fun and making me want to get up every week and still upload. Love you guys, have a happy new year and see you guys next year. Got your hands on the Galaxy S8? Show us the first photo you took. It was a dick pic. Nice. That's Samsung's flag. I love Samsung. Love it, love it. This is what you call macro photography mode. This is what you call it. Do you watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Kullu? Of course, brother. Bikaner Nine-Nine. Who willingly eats and enjoys oatmeal? What the f**k is oatmeal?

I'm gonna link in the description everybody we are checking out today. Go and check out their channel as well. Let's start with that. Hello, people! My name is Jeej Rani. You are watching Indian Vlogger Jeetu. Before starting this video, don't forget to hit the subscribe button and don't forget to follow me on Instagram. Add the link in the description. Why do all the YouTubers think that all the viewers are gonna get a pun mail tomorrow morning? I've left it on 2x. Who said that? Eminem from Snapdeal. So, guys, before starting the video, let me tell you that if you are watching this video with your family, then don't watch it at all. If you are completely frank with your family, In India, the meaning of frank is something else, right? Like we use it. Dude, yesterday I told my dad that I'm pregnant. Then what happened? Well, dad got very frank with me after that. That's why... Full frank. And started abusing. Frank on dad. Must watch. Or if you want entertainment, then watch it. I mean, the word is a little... I mean, the word pregnant is used. I mean, you'll understand. So, don't watch it at home. Pregnant word is used. I don't understand. Pregnant word is used on boys. Dad, why are you saying this? I don't want a censor certificate before any movie. I want this guy to come before every movie. This can be used even before Mirzapur. See, you can't be frank with your family. What the hell is he saying? He's just chatting. Come back, Sunilpal. Dad,underwear these guys will get detention. This is my advice. Whoever has a bed fixed on the wall, Don't misbehave with them, Because once you cross the limit, It's hard to cross the limit. So, when you cross the limit, Don't misbehave like this. Cross the limit. Have fun with your family, Okay. Oh God. So today. the transformers concepts",

    "whisperTranscription": "It's 1 a.m. Yesterday, exactly around this time, my channel got hacked. I had two-factor authentication on my channel, but still it got hacked. Whatever video I uploaded on this channel, everything got private. Some random live stream was going on on the channel. My Google account, which is linked to every single thing, was compromised. And for a few hours, I was certain that someone is going to blackmail me, threaten me. All the hard work of the last 3-4 years is gone. And I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't scared. I was petrified. I was panicky. But my first instinct when I found out this was happening, I called Naveed, I called Revanth, I called Aastha. Naveed and Revanth are the most dependable people I know, and I just knew that they'd be there. And I want to give a huge shout out to Aastha from YouTube India, who for the last 24 hours has just been constantly supportive, has just reassured me that everything will be okay. So please, can we have Aastha Hopi in the chat? I wish every creator has their own Naveed, Revanth and Aastha. I was very scared for a bit, but then I saw that stupid Tesla Corp live stream that began. And then I was like, I've seen this scam before. It's happened to a lot of people. Many, many creators reached out to me since last night. Thank you to every single one of you who reached out. You know who you are. But there was a brief moment where I felt like, f**k, this YouTube channel is gone. I'll have to shut down another YouTube channel that I've started. But within like 5 minutes, I was like, okay, we'll start another channel. We'll reach 1 million again. What is this? And I realized that I just love making videos. I just love this process too much. If I had to start from zero, I'd do it again. I don't care. While that's easy to say, I don't know how I would truly feel if I lost everything. But I do know that I felt incredibly grateful that I still have all of you people watching. When the channel came back, the view count all of a sudden became normal. And I'm so lucky that my normal is thousands of people watching me every hour. I'm very grateful. I'm very lucky. I'm very privileged.",

Yeah, that was the condition of the space, so I reached out to the lovely folks at LiveSpace to help me custom make a setup for me and here's how that went. I don't even know Hindi, but I was crying when I saw the movement of Tanmay Bhatt's house. I've seen it 3 times. Sir, do you know whose house is this? It's Adnan's. Finally ready. So this is the podcasting space where hopefully guests will come over and we should podcast only if they agree to come over. Otherwise it's just me and Shanks doing a podcast together.

I'm linking it in the description and the pinned comment. You guys should go check out the show. All the cricket stuff, if you want it first, check out Cheeky Singles. On today's vlog, we'll be showing you guys what it's like to go watch an IPL game inside the stadium. And all of us are going together because as you guys know, watching an IPL game is better together. So better on TV but we're still going. Today, we're going to watch RCB vs Mumbai Indians. And I've been to Mumbai and Bangalore as well. So today, I'm naturally conflicted. So I've decided that I'm going to be supporting Chennai Super Kings in today's game. Rajasthan, Butler Rocks. Why are you eating my punchline? I've already said it. Jokes are not better together. Shankar, you're copying my joke. It's wrong, sir. And since there's so much hype for this game, obviously, Vishal and I will be very disappointed at the end of it. It'll end in the 10th over. It won't end in the 10th over but it'll definitely happen in the 20th over. I got a call from RCB asking if I could come as an impact player. And then it was morning and I woke up. So I didn't reply to them after that. Chennai Swamy Stadium, as you guys know, very, very short boundaries. So we're hoping for lots of sixes. And if we do proper stretching and put our hands out, we might even be able to touch Virat. It's such a small boundary in today's game. Why are you throwing garbage on the road? Anyway, stick around for the vlog. We'll show you what's the fun of watching an IPL match in a stadium. Say something. Sir, you're waiting. Last time when we went to Chennai Swamy, Vishal and I watched a test match. It took us a year to get over that trauma. Our stand is Internet Explorer of Stands. Today we're watching an IPL game, which is hopefully more exciting.",

I prefer to watch cricket with the naked eye. Why do people say naked eye, when they can just say eye? Because eye is not wearing clothes. People just want to know. Are we starting with basics, our definition of naked now? Yeah, so we see with the naked eye. There's nothing to laugh about. Then don't laugh, Kullu. Let's get into some memes. Virat, may I please ask you to speak about this limited edition t-shirt? They're very limited, so... That's awesome. That's a limited answer. Yeah, please get your hands on these special t-shirts. They look great. The material is brilliant. It has a hole for the neck, it has two for arms, one for full stomach also. It can only do limited edition, not subtraction.

I want you guys to watch the next 5 minutes and don't just directly skip to the meme review. Trust me, you wanna watch this. So as you guys know, since the lockdown, I've been living with some flatmates. And a few months ago, I shifted to Bangalore with Rewandt, Shankar and chat. Shankar has his own room, Rewandt has his own room. And I have to admit, we all live like savages. Our house is like a boy's house. In fact, Shankar and Rewandt live more like boys than me. When we shifted, we just dove straight into work. We didn't get a chance to make our house beautiful. So a few weeks ago, the lovely folks from Wakefit got in touch with me. And with a lot of love, they said, Tanmay, we saw your house in the vlogs, but why don't you do up your house? So I said, hmm, this is a good opportunity to surprise Shankar and Rewandt. So first, I got in touch with my friend Sadhvi. She's a really good designer and she was kind enough to offer to help. On the 28th and 29th, okay, Shankar and Rewandt, they're now gonna be home. We can prep through this whole week. Then Sadhvi came home to check out the big style that we all live in. Welcome. So this is where we usually hang out. Shankar spends the most time on these couches. Lovely fan sent this over. I've worked so little that I haven't even put this up yet. This is Chad's couch. Also, those three are Chad's couches. This is Shankar's room. And a mini fridge, of course. And a mini fridge. It doesn't work. There's very little light in this room. Because both of these, like, they're in front of another building. Lots of green, some cushions, some art. Yeah. Looking nice. Let's check out this house's ugliest room. This is Rewandt's room. And oh my God! There are five different computers here. Lot of equipment. Honestly, I've seen worse. I like that he's using the surfaces. Add some colour in here a little bit. Because there's literally, all the rooms so far, black and white. I can't wait to show you my room. Oh, there's more black and white? Ta-da! Isn't there a lot of colour? Oh my God! It's exactly the same.",

Some of you are spending the new year sitting at home, sitting with family, sitting with friends. And for you especially, we've made this special 90-minute episode. This year has been quite special. I made a bunch of big changes to my life, got a little healthier through the year. I rediscovered that I love sitting with my friends and making jokes and having you folks to laugh with. And the guys will never tell you this, but I can tell you that still, till date, every time a video drops and the video does well, all of you guys are commenting. We are reading all of it. We get screenshots of the funniest comments on the WhatsApp group. We get screenshots of the memes you guys make. DOG gang WhatsApp group is always buzzing thanks to you guys. And when I see comments like, this feels like I'm sitting with a bunch of friends and watching memes myself. Or someone says, I've had a very bad week and you know, this made me smile. That's the stuff that gives me most joy. You guys feel like you're sitting with friends and having a laugh? That's exactly how we feel. And that is why this is still so fun to do. Anyway, I don't want to get too senty. Point is, thank you. I love all of you. I hope to see you and laugh with you again in 2023. And I hope you enjoy this episode. And before we go, here's a message from the OG gang themselves. Hello, hello, hello friends. I just want to say thank you for this entire year of memeing with us, reacting with us, watching with us. Just casually dropping bangers in the chat. Sometimes the best bangers of the episode. I hope you have a really happy new year. I hope you have a really safe new year.

And today is a very special day in the Indian gaming community because Valorant is having an agent launch event in India. The agent's name is Varun Batra aka Harbour. And today at Famous Studio, there's going to be one full launch event which is being live streamed to the whole world. And I'm going to be hosting this along with Abish Mathew. And today we're going to be meeting a bunch of gamers from the industry. So we're going to his shoot. Everybody, let's come in. Sir, Gaja has come. She's also standing to meet us. Hi guys, how are you doing? Okay, so guys, this is the new agent. Abish thinks he looks like Ranbir Singh. I think he looks like Vidyut Jambwal. I just don't think Harbour would ever do a movie called Harbour by Jyota. This is Vidyut Jambwal. Does he look exactly like Harbour? I mean, just put up a macho photo of Ranbir Singh. Does this look like Harbour? Come on. Please tell us in the comment section who is right. Me or Abish. He's a real controller. Show India. Show India. I'm debuting my new shoes. This is the Bata 700. Big fan of Bata's. I've been following Bata's music for very long. Woo! Brand new Bata's, guys. Do you remember we used to wear these in school when we were kids? These Bata's with canvas shoes. Brown colored socks. If we didn't wear Bata's, he'd always hold the monitor. Why didn't you wear Bata's today? Shout out to Bata. Big fan. Indian company, not Italian. Love them. Thank you so much. That's Ocean. Hello. That's Abish. That's Mamba SRs. Abish was telling us how his favorite game is a game called Rim World. It's a strategy game where you don't control the players. They all come with their personalities. You can just schedule it for them. And then they all lick each other's asses. Did you just understand why we've been laughing?

Crying while laughing at memes. What can we do? It's a challenge for Tanmay. I will laugh and show it today. Crying while laughing doesn't mean this. It's the title of the episode.

I've never seen anyone sweep. You know, if I'm playing against Pakistan, as I'm generally saying, I know that they don't want to hit this, they don't want to hit that. They want to hit good shots. Mid-on, mid-off, mid-wicket, square-legs. After me, they stopped hitting. It was the last one. After the 2007 finals, they stopped hitting. Joginder Sharma has entered the chat. Who wrote in the chat? This is not what a smiling face means. They don't have any problems. But, state competition. Something I've never seen before. That's a younger Nick Maddison. He just pulled the damn sandwich out of the pocket. This is in the middle of play. He's had a couple of bites at it. I think it goes back in the pocket after this.

If he touches a few balls, he'll win. Rahul Gandhi's journey to India started in Australia. I can't believe after these many years, he's still in the news. He hasn't done anything. It's been 8-10 years, Rahul Gandhi hasn't done anything. And how does K.L. Rahul feel about it? Just think about it. K.L. Rahul is calling. Rohit, he doesn't even play cricket. What are you doing?

I've watched this video 10-15 times and still can't wrap my head around it. So, every one of these balls is going in a straight line. None of them curve and none of them change direction. But as you'll notice, as they add more balls, it looks like the balls are moving in a circle rather than moving in straight lines.

My underwear is coming off. Look, he's just inflating it for me. The flight from Mumbai to Bangalore was for 4,500 rupees. And the cab from Bangalore to Tanmayagarh is for 2,000 rupees.

I'm also wondering. So, the thing is, Britannia Bon Bon is running a Football Friends Contest. Where you get a QR code on a packet of Britannia Bon Bon. You have to scan that QR code and a game opens. You have to select whether you're playing on the same device or a different device. After the game starts, you just have to tap the intensity of your kick and decide. And decide in which direction you want to kick by moving your head. If you come on the top leader board in the game, you'll get a chance to go to Qatar. Today's agenda is very simple. Samay and I will play a game. And let's see who does better in this game. I think I'm the better player. I think I'm the better player. Bro, I spend the whole day playing chess on my phone. Yeah, but have you seen me? I'm the most unathletic person. Samay and I will play 1 round each. And whoever loses 1 round, will have to do a simple dare. Okay? I'll make you do a dare today. Let's see. Alright, the game has started. We'll play now. We'll choose and play on the same device. Shankar, will you make me do something crazy? I'm done with my face, show your BFFs. I think I'm the better player. Let's go.",

He made his debut at the tender age of 17 itself. Making it very hard for me to live inside my house. Because all my parents ever kept saying... ...that if Parthiv can do this at the age of 17... ...then what are you doing here? He has played for more IPL teams that have existed. Please give it up for... The one and only Parthiv Patel. Thank you. And I have won 2-3 teams along with him. Kochi and Hyderabad. Parthiv, I heard the scouting for Mumbai Indians is going really well. So I wanted to know how does scouting work? I mean, you go to different streets in Dadar... ...and you just see the street drive. What do you do? Actually, the scouting was good. If you see, we selected 3-4 players. The scouting players were good. That's why our job is not in danger. Really? Because... Did you notice that the scouting players were good? They are already scouted. You tell me. They did a good job. Sir, I would like to tell you that we also play on the turf of Andheri... ...if we have time in Mumbai. Sir, we play with the band of St. Andrews at the City Mall. Mr. Nishant, you heard the scout, but not the talent part. GK, how's it going? Have you been having breakfast with anybody new recently? I lost my cool after the IPL. I mean, it was such a long IPL. And then I thought, I won't play cricket anymore. I'll take a break. The India-South Africa series is back after a week. And I'm back too. I thought I'll watch it at home.",

I'm Re-Prisoner, bro. I'm going straight forward. Collecting all variants one by one. What's this time? Monkey Pox? That will also happen. Don't worry. It's ready for the next episode. Rohan, is COVID back? It's COVID again but it's over now. Because it was over last week and now it's over. So, I'm Re-Prisoner and Un-Prisoner. I've been on a journey. I had COVID last week. F**k, we didn't record anything. I didn't even use your COVID sickness. I purposely kept quiet about it. I was like, I'm gonna rest this time. I was like, I'm just gonna rest. I'm gonna get better. Focus on healing. So, you had COVID and you recovered between two episodes, basically. Between two episodes. I recovered between two episodes. Yes, I did it. We also have writer OP is here. Nishant Bhai, welcome with the most useless green screen in the world. And we have a new panel member. You have seen him before. But we are welcoming back Sumit Sourav aka Hustler OP. If you want to know why the name is Hustler OP, then you should watch Sumit Sourav's new special. The new special has come on Amazon Prime Video. It's a very strong special. It's very fun. Genuinely, I had so much fun watching it that I told Sumit Bhai to come and tell the people why the name is Hustler OP. Hustler OP because I've been hustling in comedy for a long time. Like, we always think that we'll upload a video and it'll be a big hit and you'll sell the stadium. But that doesn't happen. You just wait for that. So Hustler OP is a more positive spin on Struggler OP. According to that, everyone except three people in the stand-up scene is Hustler OP. Yes. Gentlemen, today's episode is very special. Today, we're not reacting to memes. Today, we're going to watch the best moments of Indian TV serials. Let's begin Indian serial special episode. Doctor is using scotch brite to treat patient.

And Tanmay saw 3 so he got confused. Also friends, more important than how many episodes have been released and what hasn't. This Amazon Mini TV is inside the Amazon shopping app. Okay guys this is the most important information. That's why I didn't watch 2 episodes guys. So it is available on IOS and Android in India. If you're outside India you cannot watch. Everyone must have an Amazon app right? There's an Amazon Mini TV in Amazon and there's Biswa's show in it which has 5 episodes. You watch 3 and then decide if you want to watch the rest or not. At least watch 3. So let's start the episode. Yes mom I'm going for extra class. Bro what all people do for relationships. What is this? Are they here to watch Quetta's match? Which match is this? Pakistan? Pakistan. Super. The reason why the cameraman is confused is because he has heard 4 and 6 runs. Why is this girl showing 9 runs? And what is cot kit? He's not able to understand. Cot kit.",

Tanmay said, I won't fit. But I warn you, I'll break your heart. Already broke. Guys, we're going to watch the match but the real agenda is to go meet the Indian cricket team. As you guys know, Vishal and I had written an ad, you know, with a coach of the Indian cricket team. He has sent me a message. I'm sure that after today, me and Vishal will be hanging out in the dressing room. Watch this vlog till the end. Watch this vlog till the end. What's the problem? I'm very drunk. What do you think of the empty cricket stadium? Where's the third one? You've already lost the tickets. Vishal, Vishal. It's okay, it's okay. Sir, what's the score? 8 wickets. It's been 15 minutes. We'll do something. Charger is not allowed, guys. Charger is not allowed. How much is the charger? Guys, we can't go inside the stadium with a phone charger. So now we're just waiting outside the stadium. Labita has opened a shop for chargers. That's why you carry two phones. And no wire. We're still waiting outside the stadium. Sri Lanka is all out. Test match is over. IPL is on. Several months later. We're still outside the stadium, guys. Virat Kohli's daughter has become the captain. We're still outside. 75 years later.

And remember that Destroyer is a good name. Luckily, Taha told us that where are those stumps? We have to make NFTs and sell them. Kamjandar Gurani has already banned NFTs. So he took out the stumps from the bag. It's written there. So we matched the stumps. He said that we have the same stumps. So I said that I want to do marketing with you. Please respect us. Please go check out Shoaib Akhtar NFTs. Shoaib bhai, tell me one thing. You can see memes. I want to know who is the funniest in Pakistan's cricket team? Who is the funniest?

That Rohan and I are going to build this PC on our own. Did I know how to build a PC? No. And that's why I called my friend Aymar. This is him. And he was kind enough to volunteer to help us build this beast. And so, on the day, we decided to show up at Rohan's house and surprise him with his brand new PC. Ta-da! Chad, stay away from it. Chad has his priorities set. How much stuff does it take to build a PC? It can take a lot more. And all you do is play PUBG with it. What have you told Rohan? That I'm just coming over to chill. That's not how you do it. Because you never go to anyone's place to chill. I go to Rohan's house to chill. I chill a lot. Once you've got it. In 4 years, once. So, we can play games on this, right?

So this time we're getting an Olympic gold medalist. He's called Neeraj Chopra, you might have heard of him. We're going to a famous studio in Mahalakshmi. Divya and Puneet are all there. This time, Jim Sarb will say, that gets me as excited as Indians around Neeraj Chopra. Neeraj is going to act like how people act around Neeraj, but as himself. And... Action! Is it a tough one? Is it a tough one? Is it a tough degree? Cut! Nice, nice, super! Nice, nice! It's good! It feels like you get 2-3 breaking news in a day. Like a journalist of that level. Everyone looks their butt. You look like you're unhappy with your job. They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine, when you're not really fine. You look like you've broken a story in a long time. It's late. Kiki Lail, Bibi, sorry, let's go. But it's okay. It looks good. And... Action! Is it a girlfriend? Is it a wife? Is it a girlfriend's wife? Cut! Cut! Cut! We'll take an option at the end. We're taking it as a priority, that we'll take the one we like the most. When is the fire pick coming? We'll give it some time. When is the fire pick coming? Like this, like this. The people are all laughing. I don't know, people find this line very funny, because it's kind of predictable, right? Like it falls into a pattern that they recognize. So I think this whole film will work on endearment. The fact that you are seeing him only do it. Even if it's flawed, right? People will like that. We'll see, we'll see. I don't want to disagree in front of the camera. 90% of what you're saying cannot make it to my vlog. It doesn't even make sense that he's laughing. He's shirking his shoulder and all he's doing.

Very, very illegal. But not illegal to say with a mortar launcher. Because that's its own sentence. It's an incomplete sentence, but it may have nothing to do with the sentence before that.

I also found out that it's incredibly illegal, extremely illegal to go on television... ...and say something like the best place to fire a mortar launcher at the White House... ...would be from the roof of the Rockefeller Hewitt building... ...because of minimal security and you'd have a clear line of sight to the President's bedroom.

    "whisperTranscription": "Hello! So as you guys know, a couple of months ago I worked on an ad campaign that made me really excited. It featured one of my favourites and arguably the world's favourite movie star. The one and only Shah Rukh Khan. Now I know many of you have been waiting for these vlogs but before we jump into it, just one second. First I want to give a shout out to the Hotstar team for being so nice to work with. Thank you so much guys, it was a pleasure. When they gave us the brief, they told us that don't curb your imagination. Just let it go wild. And the entire writing team thought of only one name. Oh my God, how cool would it be if we wrote for Shah Rukh Khan. See, my love and admiration for Shah Rukh, I have been very public about it. I am an extremely vocal Shah Rukh simp. He is not only charismatic, he is also incredibly fun to work with. When you work with him, he makes you feel like he has known you for years. And of course, he is by far one of the funniest people you will hang out with. He has incredible comic timing. He has an incredible understanding of how comedy is written. And for all these reasons and more, it will forever excite me to do some work with him. Like I was on this project. And not just me, but the whole writing team was so incredibly excited to work with him. You guys are gonna get to see the behind the scenes in this vlog. The only thing is that all of us were so excited like children to be shooting this campaign that I didn't get to vlog a lot while we were shooting it. We had to wrap up a lot of shoot in one single day. So I didn't want to be the weird guy who just prioritizes his vlog over the work. Having said that, I hope you guys still enjoy the vlog. This has been Shah Rukh Simp for life. Signing off, enjoy the vlog. In one of the previous episodes, One of my very good friends, Divya, he's gonna cry if he meets Ravid. Unfortunately, he's not coming to shoot. How was the shooting with Ravid? It was very good. We got 3 photos. So immediately we are sending Divya. Guys, Divya is finally here. This is Almond. Which Ravid ate from. That Ravid ate from. Like no no. It's a saliva. And now. Back on another set. This time Divya is on shoot. Yeah. We know we kept that record where one person has fallen ill. Chakta is like not coming. Okay. And so I'm replacing him. It wasn't the Shah Rukh factor that made sure that you're here. What is it? Rahul Ravid is not as cool?",

    "whisperTranscription": "Hello and welcome to another episode. Before we start the episode, I want to give a huge shoutout to the sponsors of today's video, Smallcase. When it comes to making my stock investments, Smallcase is easily by far my favourite app to use. What is a Smallcase? A Smallcase is nothing but a basket of stocks with a particular idea or theme. For example, one small case that I have personally invested in is a small case called Dividend Aristocrats. In Dividend Aristocrats Smallcase, there are stocks of those companies which perform well in the long term, but they also give dividends. If I had to make a list of these companies myself, it would have taken too much time and too much effort. Instead, I just bought a small case. When COVID started, I bought another small case called Pharma Tracker. In Pharma Tracker Smallcase, as you guessed it, there are stocks of all pharmaceutical companies. So when COVID started, I had a feeling that pharmaceutical companies will perform really well in this decade. That's why I invested in this. Just like these two examples I gave, there are many many small cases for many many different ideas. You guys can check it out. If you're thinking about starting to invest, then check out Smallcase. They made my investment journey super easy. Click on the link in the pinned comment to check out Smallcase. On that note, let's start today's video. Hello and welcome to another episode of Pakistani Savagery. We are joined today of course with subscriber Rupi. Beginning with subscriber Rupi. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. We have with us shy Rupi. Welcome, welcome. And of course we have Gopal sir, which is sider Rupi. Because everyone else is sider, welcome. Today we are going to see our neighbour's savageness again. Which is his savageness. It's his savageness. We are going to test him again. So let's not waste any more time, let's just jump right into it. First of all, this Daniel Christian is bowling during IPL. Ahmed, I know you're watching the match, please unblock me. I want to come back in your life. Do you know what your love is looking at at what time? So is that true love or not? This is absolutely true love. I don't know about the truth, but it's definitely love.",

Abish, have you been on dating apps? When Tinder was launched, this is before the super like was a concept. I joined it and I used to swipe right on only friends who I know and send them screenshots. I've sent you a right swipe. Please accept. Wow. You want a cheesy pickup line or a dirty one? Cheesy. Truck cheese, truck cheese, truck cheese, truck cheese, truck cheese. And dirty? It's working, sir. It's working. Are you an FDA approved respiratory mask? Because I want you to sit on my face. Send me a Snapchat. Oho. Sir, the boy has definitely killed it. Yes, sir.

    "whisperTranscription": "Good morning. I've just woken up. I came from Bangalore yesterday. Everyone in Bombay is screwed. A lot of you guys don't know this, but Naveed was tested positive for corona in Goa. He had gone there to do a course. And I've just been informed that he's gone to the hospital because his O2 levels were low. They're just going to the hospital to make sure everything is fine. If anything happens to Naveed, I'll burn the whole of Goa. Goa. Hey, Goa. You want to hear it, right? Hey guys, welcome to the new vlog. Chad. Hey. Hey. Chad, leave. Leave. Good boy. So the last few weeks have been pretty crazy. I haven't uploaded a single vlog because a lot was happening around me. First, I had gone to Delhi to shoot something really cool for my second channel. And while I was there, the second wave had just started to pick up. So I packed my bags and came back to Bombay. And after I came back, I found out that Naveed had COVID and he had to be hospitalized. And right then with me was Raghav, who was at home with me. And he also was showing some COVID symptoms. So you guys can imagine, it was a lot of chaos, a lot of tension, a lot of stress. But thankfully, things are okay now. Everybody is fine and we're all cooped up at home. So in today's vlog, we'll catch up with everything that's been happening with us over the last month. Where things got really bad, then it got worse. But then eventually, things got much better. And I hope that the journey we've had at home gives hope to some of you who've had a very tough couple of months. On that note, enjoy the vlog. Love you all. A couple of days later, God answered our prayers. And Naveed told us that he was feeling a little better. And he was breathing well enough to be able to talk to us. Today is my 14th day of COVID. The fever is gone. I don't have a fever. It was a little tough at night after 3 PM. Around 2-3 PM. I had a mild infection in my lungs. They are giving me injections like 4 injections in the morning. And 2-3 injections in the evening. So basically, those injections are paroids and a heavy dose of medicines to help the lungs to recover. And when I started having breathlessness for 2 days, I used to take Goa to the medical college. I used to go to the follow-up clinic. So I was basically a little severe. I just want to shower. If I stay out of oxygen for 2 minutes, then my breathlessness gets a little heavy. So I'm timing it a little. Take a sip.",

I don't know, there is a lot of boys who are getting convinced by this story. Actually, it must not have happened. This was done just to make a meme. Look, Rahul, understand one thing. Okay?

And Shankar told Rewan how his bike broke down and he needed a new bike. The budget has been running out for the past 3 years. This is our bike. It's been running for the past 4 years. The problem is that it doesn't come fast. So we decided to play a very fun free-to-play game called Crash Bandicoot. And the winner would get 1 lakh rupees. And no matter who wins, we decided that it was time for Shankar to get a new bike. Alright, today we are doing something very special. Last time we played a game and the winner got 25,000 rupees. Today we are going to play and the winner is going to get 1 lakh rupees. Take out 1 lakh. Take her out of the house. She is just stealing way too much of our money. I am not okay with it. I am scared. Last time we played a game. The priest just walks in. Alright, today we are playing a very new and very fun game. It's called Crash Bandicoot. The person who gets the highest points, Raghav I am pointing towards you, is going to win 1 lakh rupees. So, let the games begin. Are you excited? Listen, when you are making the chits, just write Raven on all the papers. I want R, I want J, I want Raven. Okay, so we are not actually playing the game. Oh, good. No. Good what?

She'll get down and come. What were you doing? I knew I had to bank on you for 11 PM plans. I was like, let's take a shower here and go to the freezer. Khusha texted, she was like, are you free tomorrow night? I said, okay, tomorrow night if you wanna hang. Which we never hang, by the way. We just keep making plans, we never hang. Empty plans. I said, okay, we'll meet tomorrow. Then I was like, I have to shoot as well. You should. But do you have anything planned? No. I was asking her questions like, what time are you landing? Like what's the scene? I even asked like, is anybody coming to pick you up? I was like, we're already there. Someone else is already there. All these stupid people. Let's go.

I'm gonna take it to a gift shop to get it wrapped. They sell it as a body massager online. Naveed thinks I'm going to get my laptop fixed, so he became all generous mom-like. Oh, we know some vendors, you don't have to go. They'll come, they'll charge less. And I got really scared because I'm going to get him a dildo prank. We have a very nice message for him. And we're gonna write it here. It's just super awkward to write a letter to Naveed. I'm writing lines like, Please don't refuse a letter without reading it. Thank God someone ate a bat in China last year and I have to wear a mask while doing this. The card is ready. The prank is set. Now for the least awkward part, getting a dildo gift wrapped in a kid's shop. Okay, so it was getting really awkward to get that bagged here. So I decided to get this along with it.

In fact, a lot of people don't know that the original design for this was carried by the architect in their anal. Oh! Excuse me, we're trying to shoot a movie. Yeah. Anyway, you were saying about the anal beads. You know, in fact, the only reason that he escaped detection at customs is because this was the same day that Koinamitra was stopped for carrying gold. And he was distracted. And that's how he escaped detection. Koinamitra was stopped for carrying gold? I don't know, man. A lot of people, over the last couple of years, I just keep reading headlines that people are stopped for carrying gold. So, I apologize to Koinamitra. She was not actually stopped.

Today, we are reviewing the videos of those people who have boredom in their relationship. Do you know what they do? Cheating. They forget the hand. That hand goes somewhere else. I have also done this a lot. I did it in the 10th grade. In the paper of Sanskrit. What? Cheating with the hand? No, no. In the paper of Sanskrit. Nishant Bhai, the name of the channel is I am Mihir. And Mihir made this video which got a lot of views. So Mihir, thank you for letting us react to this. And I am hoping that it gets half of the views. That would be great. Is there a way to beg? Hi guys, I am Mihir. And she is Urvashi. And this is One and All. Today, I am going to prank my girlfriend again. And let's see how her reactions will be when she sees me with Urvashi. And the way Abhishek just called her, I hope she doesn't come at any time. So please, I am waiting for her to come. Yes, yes, yes. He is the first person who has made himself emotional. Bro, this lipstick doesn't look like this. This is not lipstick, this is blood. This is a cheating lipstick. This is not normal. This is not normal. Normal lipstick doesn't look like this. Yes, it looks small. When you cheat, then you have to do something like this. Yuck! What have you done? Please, go very close to that moment. And put it in Nishant Bhai's mouth. No, no, no. By the way, he has taken a big risk. This guy sat like this. Yes, I am ignoring that I shouldn't look there. I shouldn't see anything wrong. I am waiting for her to come. Please, I am waiting for her to come. It was necessary to go under the bed in the end. This extra 5 million was to be brought. This is the 90s Bollywood inside us. Without the bed, there is no sex.

Let's start today's game, Nishant bhai! What are we doing today? Today I have to do something college-centric! Because it's been a long time since I've seen 2-3 million videos! Nishant bhai, do you remember what were your expectations when you first went to college? The Bollywood expectation was that the girl in front of me will bring a lot of books in her hand! I will also keep a few books in my hand! Both of us will bump into each other and the books will fall! And what happened? The kids don't come to college! Everyone's problems! My expectation was that I will go to college, study, get a good job and remain stable! And what happened? Welcome to another reaction video with me and Raja Ropi today!

Look at the t-shirt! It doesn't look like this t-shirt is made only for the college boys! Some t-shirts are like this! My favourite t-shirt was like this! I was born intelligent but education ruined me! No! You were born an idiot! Education made you an educated idiot! It feels like this is the closest to Scrabble he would be in his life! Is this element correct? What is this? Beryl... Beryllium and Erbium! Is it correct? Thank you, brother! For the first time, someone must have studied so hard that everyone bought this t-shirt! You see, his entire look is so mega college, right? This pop socket is also like a skull! And have you ever worn a cap straight in college? You might have worn it! I tried to look as cool as possible... I had that band in my hand, the 2-3 people who used to come at that time... He bought this friendship band himself!",

Now, I know whenever I stream, a lot of you want to talk to me, but you don't have the money to super chat. So I spoke to the folks at Fampay, and we decided to do something cool for you guys. What is Fampay? Fampay is India's first neobank for teenagers. That's right. It's a neobank for teenagers only, so adults can f**k. When you sign up to Fampay, you get your own cool card and a UPI ID, both of which you can customize. My card says TanmayBot. This is just a sample card because I'm not 18. If you successfully sign up on to Fampay, you get a Rs. 101 deposited in your Fampay account. And via UPI, you can super chat to any streamer that you want, or spend it on anything else. Now, what is a successful sign up? You have to be below 18, you have to do your KYC and your parents' KYC. Takes just a minute. But Tanmay, why do my parents have to do it? Because you are not 18. And if Mr. Modi finds out that UPI IDs are being sold here without his parents' knowledge, then he will personally send Mr. Amit to my house. And lastly, this offer is only available for Bot Army Janta. I specially spoke to them and made this happen for us. There's a link in the description. Download it and send a super chat to your favorite streamer. It might not be me, that's fine. But if you send to me, I'll be very happy. Alright, then moving on. Mr. Amit, I am a master of Among Us. I am the master. If there's one game that I shall conquer, it's going to be this one. I am a master.",

And I was like, I found the answer. Naveed, I'm kidding. Very true. We thought that now is a good time to get a dog. There's always someone or the other to be with the dog, to take care of the dog, to offer their hand as sacrifice so the dog can eat your whole hand if needed. Seriously. Not just hands, ears, nose, everything. We need help, guys. It's been 25 minutes since we've been trying to record this link. And it's still not happened. So yes, the rumours are true. I'm no longer the cutest, the most adorable, the nicest, the loveliest. Or as Shankar puts it, nobody cares. But on the bright side, we have a dog. And we're so tired already. So a friend of mine had a lab, she had four pups. And she asked me saying, I don't want to keep all four. Do you know someone who might want to adopt one? She first asked me to post on my Instagram. And then I said, hey, I might know someone who wants a dog. So everyone's been asking me, what is his name, Tanmay? What's his name? And we finally have a name. The name is... Maneesh. That's not a good name. Who names their dog Maneesh? Okay, so the fact of the matter is that we don't know the name yet. Because naming your pet is like getting a tattoo. I mean, once you get it...",

It'll look weird for a while. You'll think you should take a shower. You'll think about it. But after that, Nishant, think about it. After 30 seconds. Because I'm pretty sure I'll be amazing. After 30 seconds, 10 crores in the bank. You won't do it for any number. 100 crores. Nishant, you'll never have to work in life. If you get 100 crores. Sir, I just want to ask.

Let me get my joystick. We'll do the underwear challenge. I'm on the keyboard right now, so I have a handicap. I recently spoke to Harsh Benimal. Hello. Can you hear me? Nishant Bhai is not playing this game, so I have a handicap. But you and I can play this game. The name of this game is Chutiya Challenge. In Fall Guys? In Fall Guys. In Chutiya Challenge, in every game, if you and I are playing, Nishant Bhai is not doing this, but if you and I are playing, if you lose before me, you'll have to write C on your forehead with a marker. Okay, fine. If I lose, I'll have to write C. Like this, C-H-U-T-Y-A. We're removing an I. Chutiya Challenge. Chutiya. Chutiya. I don't know what's going on in my mind. I don't know if I should tell Harsh or not. What do you want to tell him? I just want to tell him that when you find a marker to write with, just make sure there's nothing permanent on it. Harsh Bhai, get ready. I'm playing number one. He's killing me. If we both win, is there a problem? No, if we both win, there's no problem. If we both lose, we'll have to write C. Are you qualified?

Instead of slapping upwards, if he would have slapped downwards on the lamp. I would have peed in the lamp. And my next wish is Sodium Nitrate. I will throw it. Go, throw it. Just to make him throw the garbage, he took his 2000 rupee note, made a hole in it with a needle, tied it with a thread, went and threw it in the garbage with his own hands.

Where? How? We'll go on a vacation. So I have decided to invent something nice to eat from scratch. Alright, who would have thought we would have seen this day, Naveed? Huh? Did you ever think that not only will you be India's number one food vlogger, defeat India's number one food channel conqueror, Asia, chef, cuisine, master, Sanjeev Kapoor.",

We, we, today, we will give credit to TikTok. Mr. Goswami, who will give credit to Netflix Prime. In 5 minutes of that, I received the first call from one of my sources at the highest levels of the government. It said, Arnab, we have blocked 59 apps. And among those apps is TikTok. Does the government personally call Arnab now? Government? Nishant, I don't like you questioning Arnab like this. Nishant, you know, as much as I respect you, you cannot attack Arnab like this, okay? You are attacking... No, I am not. Please don't ban me. You can kill me with a knife, if you want to attack Arnab. Please, don't ban me from anywhere. I didn't say anything. Arnab is the best person. I go into details of who these apps are. And you'll know it. Many of you may be users of these apps. Viewers and fellow Indians, we really need to support what the government is doing now. Support it, guys. Immediately delete all the apps from your phone. But wait a second. What's the option after getting banned? You call that support? That the government of India duly elected is fighting on behalf of more than 130 crore Indians. I think it is an intense step. Nishant sir, first of all, the lockdown has been increased. Okay? You can't leave the house. The time you are passing at home, that is also not allowed. F**k you. 59 Chinese apps blocked. And we have with us our executive editor, Abhishek Kapoor and Niranjan Narayan Swamy on the details of... Abhishek Kapoor and Niranjan Narayan Swamy, please give it immediately. While there is a possibility of a second list, the reason perhaps why Zoom is not there is because I believe it's registered in the United States. So there was some technicality there.

Today, we will review these world records. Let's start, friends, with our first world record for most hugs in one minute. There are two timers. No, I love that there are two timers here. I don't know why, what precision is needed in this. And secondly, I love what this guy is doing here. His only job is to come and hug. We have paused this moment. This is not a hug. This is a non-consensual hug at this point. Why do I feel that the person who has made this record is a school principal. And his students are forcing him to do it. His students are just bumping into each other. The kids are going home and saying, Mom, do I have a shirt with thorns on it? You have to make a hole in the principal's nipple. He didn't complete one hug. And he didn't stop there. He hugged him again. I saw that he didn't complete the hug. That pink shirt guy got scared. Did he have fun with me? The kids are getting smaller. The kids are getting smaller. How much did he bend? How much did he bend? Look how disappointed the last kid is.",

When I was a kid I was never taught to express or receive love properly. As a result of which I am an attention whore through the year. But the one day I get a lot of attention and actual genuine affection. That day I feel a little weird. I don't know why. Plus there is so much pressure on birthdays. Oh wow birthday, let's do something fancy. Let's have fun. I don't want to do it. I don't like all that. But I think this year's birthday was good. Something good happened a few days before the birthday. First Rohan came home with a cake. Mr. Deepika, where did you get this beautiful mask from? I am Kajol. What is Kajol? F**k me, I haven't gotten out of the house in so long. Chintu cake. Chintu cake, this is the best I could do for a cover. Yum. What? Why are you wearing Madonna's bra as a mask? I am wearing a bra. It's time to get out of the house. So let's go that way from here. From here? Let's walk around and enter through the other gate. Let's f**k it and go home. Are we clicking pictures of this? Wait. It's a lot of effort. F**k you. And then we thought since Rohan got the cake, we should give something back. So Naveed and I made ice cream for Rohan in return. And when I say Naveed and I, I mean me. I am kidding, Naveed does everything. So we are taking ice cream for him. How nice. Mango ice cream? For everyone. Rohan, this has been lying in the fridge for the last 10 days. No, no. F**k. Oh, okay. We didn't press the button.",

Cornetto is such a friend that you get to see something good. Every Cornetto, no matter how f**k all. Even if you're eating Pista flavor, you get to see a beautiful chocolate hug at the end. Which I really like. Agreed. I also used to love it until you called it Chocolate Ka Hugga. At which point now, it's just not required anymore. What absurd romance poetry are you writing? When the best metaphor you can come for the thing you love is Chocolate Ka Hugga. One more. Zakir's face had a reaction. Zakir wanted to appreciate it. I couldn't hug it. Leave it. Or roast by any other name. It will smell as sweet. And it's Chocolate Ka Hugga. Sorry, what I meant to say was, at the end, when Cornetto leaves, he leaves with the happiness of a chocolate. Is that better? You ruined it. You ruined it forever. For minimum 4 people. I have an opinion about Cornetto. That waffle concept, it's his dad. And he packaged it in such a way, that you buy it, open it and eat it. Correct. You don't have to wait for anything. All this nonsense, mango, banana, pineapple, we have put it all. This is it.

Today you guys are going to watch my first ever episode of my new Graphy. What is a Graphy? Well, Graphy is a fun new app where you can watch vertical videos of things that can help you learn, things that can help you understand, things and things that can help you grow. Think of it like a place where you can essentially get the knowledge you get from books, but through vertical video. And my first ever Graphy is a show called Yours Anonymously. We spend a lot of time on the internet where mostly we consume, you know, social media content and what's going on on YouTube and just content to entertain us. And in that process, we forget that there is a lot on the internet. There are so many people from around the world talking about their experiences. So I thought why not make a show where me and another comedian guest, we go through many of these stories from around the world and see what we can learn from them. And along with that, the fun will continue. The full episodes are available on Graphy. There's an episode coming out every week. You can just download the app and check it out. The link is in the description. On that note, check out the first episode. Cheers! So let's start. The public was asked if you have witnessed any I don't give a f**k moment or not. So there's a story from that, I want to tell you. There was an engineer in my firm, someone told me. He was under a lot of pressure. For a few months, he was also doing a lot of off-topic work. There was a meeting where he was bombarded with useless questions. He lost his mind. Then the management started giving hostile comments. When he was answering, he suddenly stopped for a second. And then said, I'm done.",

You can watch this film with your family on TV. Don't watch my content with your family on my streams. But do watch this film. Watch it when it's out. The film is releasing on 5th June. I want to tell you guys about the directors of this film, Devanshu and Satyanshu. I met Devanshu for the first time in my college. I did my B.M.M. from National College. On the first day of college, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. Come in front of the class, tell us your name and tell us something about yourself. That day, I did a funny rap while introducing myself. Devanshu was a guy who was very thin at that time. He's not that thin now. He had a very serious moustache. He had a moustache and he was standing in front of the class. And he wrote on the board, Devanshu means Dev plus Anshu. Dev-Anshu, like a part of the board. I was intrigued. We were all trying to be cool. And a guy named Devanshu came here. You know, there was a slight misfit element to him. And he said that he has come from a small city in Bihar, Munger. And he said that he's very excited to learn about the media industry. That day, after college, I was at the train station. And I saw Devanshu as well. And that day, he told me that he was going home. I said, I have never been to Mirror Road. Let's go together. And I took the train. We started walking. I saw that Deva was living on a small shanty. There was a flat where there was no paint on the walls. Everything was scattered. And it was the month of July. And that was the big monsoon season in Mumbai. I don't know if a lot of you remember. But at that time, there was...",

So, today I'm going to discuss about both MBA and CBSE. Let's see how much you guys remember from those times. So, this is the social science paper. What do they teach in social science, KV? History, Geography, Civics and Economics. Because I'm from the SSE board, so I don't know what happens in the other boards. In SSE, I used to find SSE very difficult. And whenever I meet a CBSE or ICSE student, they say that SSE is difficult. CBSE is to be tougher than ICSE in terms of scoring marks. In ICSE, 98-99% of the top students will come to school. Across the board, the question paper looks the same. As if it was made by an uninterested graphic designer. But I remember the roll number very clearly. He used to write it with his ears. He used to match each and every number with his admit card. And the brain switches on to avoid any mistakes. Whenever I used to write the roll number, I used to think that if I got the roll number wrong... ...then my whole life is ruined. 15 minutes time has been allotted to read the question paper. Oh my God! You guys used to get 15 minutes to read the question paper? I don't remember that. Doesn't it happen, KV? I don't remember that I used to get 15 minutes extra. No, I don't remember that either. They used ICSE to make this process. What the f**k! I am so pissed off. 15 minutes to read the question paper, 5 minutes to cry. 20 minutes to reflect on your life choices. 10 minutes to figure out how to run away from home after the paper. I will become an actor in Bombay in 10 minutes. Each question carries one mark. The answer to these questions should not exceed 30 words. Wow! You wrote the answer in a tweet. You are quite advanced at that point. But I don't think we have this level of specification. Write this much in this much number. Write it on the level of tweet. Write it on the level of Facebook. Write it on the level of Instagram. Write it on the level of LinkedIn.",

Tell me one thing, who says good evening? Who is this family where good evening is a thing? Close the gate, dad. Don't let mom come out. No. Please, please. Why? Don't freak out. Dad, close the gate. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong so far. In middle class houses, there is no such thing as privacy. By the way, he said that dad wants to talk to you. I looked at him and asked if he's wearing a belt or not. I told you about that girl, right? Do you remember? That bitch said it. Promise, you won't hit me, dad. Please. You don't come close on such occasions. She's pregnant, dad. What do you mean? I love this retort by dad. What do you mean by she's pregnant? Because in dad's mind, my son is an idiot. He probably wanted to say that she's poignant. No. What does it actually mean? Or maybe he means metaphorically that she's pregnant with joy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What did you understand? I'm sorry, dad. Oh! Isn't it too much? I'm feeling bad. It's too much.",

Yes, tell me. When the video is made but nothing is made. Then we come on call at 12-1. And we are going through the video. It's been a minute. And you are like, one minute, one minute. I have missed everything. Come back. At 1-1.30 I always say on stream. Guys, I have to go to work. What I basically mean is Hitanshu has been messaging me for an hour. I have to leave. You see a few moments in the edit. Yes, I get into that. And then a new video can be made on that. And then a new video can be made on that. And then a new video can be made on that. Hitanshu, how did you make it? Through Carry? Yes, it was through Carry. And I remember you called me for the show. And we didn't come for the show. And we met directly in the cafe. Yes, yes, yes. We have put the guest list. And we didn't come. And we came directly to the cafe. When it got late. Correct, correct. I met you through Neelaksh. In Bangalore. Yes, in Bangalore. You had uploaded a story on Instagram. Saying that you are looking for video editors. And around 4 of my friends sent me that story. Because they knew I was quitting my job.",

Yes, see what I'm saying, before we start roasting Varun, let's just take a moment and look at how fit he is. How absolutely fit he is to leave comedy. I met Varun Thakur for the first time, I asked him how are you? He said, I'm very pretty awesome. I said, get the phenyl pills out of your mouth first. Basically, in a nutshell, I want to say that when life gives you a Varun, be a Grover, not a Thakur. Varun Thakur's character, Vicky Malhotra, is a self-obsessed, misogynistic brat, which is completely opposite of what Varun himself is. Consistently un-funny. I think Varun Thakur should just buy masks for Vicky. Varun Thakur should give screen tests for his own MMS. Varun Thakur is the only person who has ruined two careers in his solo show. If Varun Thakur was Varun Grover, he would have written a poem. We won't show you the paper because not a single joke is written in it.",

Arjun doesn't require me to roast him anymore. Fantastic. But in all honesty, it's always nice to hear people talking nice things about you. I wouldn't mind in times like this to be motivated and encouraged that I should be back on the set. Maybe we'll get some of that today, alright? We're talking to some of Arjun Kapoor's biggest fans. And see what lovely things they have to say about you. And what maybe, maybe the odd chance of them saying something mean. Hi Rishabh, hi. How are you? Hi Shruti, how are you? First, tell me three things that you love about him. So, what I really like is his persona. Especially when he's on screen with Ranveer. I have to say, the kind of chemistry that they both have, it's much better than a lot of couples on screen. Rishabh, what do you think? It's his choice of films. You know, from Finding Fanny, to Ishaq Zadeh, to Two States. I love his choices of films. Especially Finding Fanny. You know, when I saw Finding Fanny, I became his fan. I really, I love his performance in Finding Fanny. Why don't you watch it like 50-60 times with all your friends? I, no, I didn't, no. Not 50-60 times. I would have went to the box office. My friend wouldn't want to watch it. Deeti, I want you to tell me, what do you find sexy about Arjun? I would have said, like his body and all. But now he has gained weight.

I can never take this music seriously, guys. I will be expecting someone to start. Friends, today I am going to tell you, how you can kidnap the whole family of a girl. By the way, you don't have to use 5 of 5 dialogues. One dialogue is enough to get the number. But... Don't ask for number 5 times, you idiot. Use only one dialogue. I am giving you 5 dialogues, so that you have options to use different dialogues. And if there is a different girl, then you can use the dialogue according to her. And you can get the number from her. So friends, dialogue number 5 is... Please guys, don't send the same girl 5 times. This tip won't work. I am convinced that in this whole series, no one is talking to an adult. For example, all these are kids. All these 9-10 year old kids are talking like this. Because no adult is doing this.

As the world is going to shut down for a few days... In our country, the coronavirus... Coronavirus? COVID-19... The name is Corona. The viral Casanova. Coronavirus! The thing about coronavirus is that if we want to stop its spread, then we don't have to do anything complicated. We don't have to collect a lot of money. We don't have to make contact with any minister. We just have to use basic common sense. And if only common sense can save us, you know what that means. That we are all going to die! Common sense opponent number one. Politician. In India, no matter what crisis there is, politicians have only one solution. I have an anus. It's a cow's uterus. Okay, this man is as much of a doctor as Dr. Vijay Mallya and Sanjay Dutt in Munnabhai MBBS. And by that, I mean, absolutely. Just like Indian mothers have Vicks, college students have Crocin, similarly, Indian politicians have cow urine. Do you have fever? Drink cow urine. Are you a cancer patient? Cow urine. Because in India, cows are our mother, cows are our father, and cows are our chemist as well. I mean, put a plus sign on every cow's head and write on the board, Bholeram Medical. In India, if you find a politician, you get thousands of votes. After this slogan, he came. Corona Santu! Because this man knows that if you want the attention of 50 media houses in India, first, you have to look like some sort of religious person. Second, you have to have some sort of completely unscientific opinion. Where there is no corona, there is corona. So, corona originated, people killed so many animals, killed so many animals, cooked them, ate them, and after eating them, the way they made a video of it, the result was that corona has come. And third, you have to use scientific terms to sell your completely unscientific opinion. We have offered prasad, kheer, and poori to corona, so eat kheer and poori and stay calm.",

I went to a Vada Pav shop. I asked, can I get Kanda Bajapa? They said, sir, Kanda Bajapa is 4,500 rupees per kilo. Obviously, you won't get it. As a privileged citizen of this country, I can't find Kanda Bajapa. Why are we calling refugees? First fix the road. Get a job. Fix Kanda Bajapa first. Then bring the refugees. This is my simple policy. Until Kanda Bajapa comes back, no refugees are allowed here. I will stay on the border. Are you a Hindu refugee? Yes. F**k off. Are you a Muslim refugee? Yes. F**k off.

    "whisperTranscription": "Today, I want to share something with you. One of my best friends, Rohan Joshi, his stand-up special came out on Amazon Prime which is called Wake & Bake. It's a very good special. I want to tell you the clip of that today. But I want to say something about this special. I had a clinical depression for about a year and I was trying to get out of the house but I couldn't. And I think I didn't work for a long time because I had a fear inside me that I was doing something wrong to myself. I had a fear inside me that I wouldn't be able to do anything on my own. Because in the last 10 years, I have worked with Rohan Ashish Khamba so much that starting again on my own it just felt so scary. And I didn't know. I had a lot of impostor syndrome when I was so successful in life that I felt like I don't know if this is because of me if I have any capability of my own. That's why I left Bombay and went to Bangalore for a few months. Because in my mind, I was like maybe I am not capable of doing anything in the media industry. Rohan's special was getting shot. That day I came to Bombay to watch the special. And after watching the special, I realized that even in our toughest one year I saw my friend Rohan he grinded it out. He didn't get bogged down by any of social media pressure. He went and did stand-up everyday. And he made this amazing special. And after watching that, I felt extremely inspired. I felt that maybe it's time for me also to take the leap and start doing things on my own. His special Wake & Bake has been released on Amazon Prime. Go and watch it. And I just wanted to do this for Rohan. I hope you guys enjoy the special as well. See you. Do we really have financial stability? Like I'll give you an example of myself. Couple of months ago I was at the store and I was trying to choose",

Yeah. Oh, man. I think so. Here's the thing I've learned. Okay. I've been in the news consistently for five years, if there's one thing I've learned everything you read in the news, not necessarily the truth. Right? Here's how the news boils down. I don't want to make any comments about everything, anything, yeah, but the news news is news follows views, right? So it's no longer about the truth. The truth is extremely complicated and nuanced. And the news is meant to be sexy and fast. The truth is not sexy and fast. The truth takes very long to understand. It's like about Kashmir, right? If someone came and said, hey, tell me about Kashmir. And you are like, okay, here's what I have read about Kashmir. Things go back 60, 70, 80 years ago, when India as a country was being formed. This person's like, I want to call someone a fag right now, why have we gone back 60-70 years ago? But if you want, if you want some, if you want to understand something in depth, it requires context, which the news doesn't have space for. Share the news right now, use it right now. So I would suggest for most people to stop looking at the news as the absolute truth. Start using your, using your brains, first of all, don't consume every piece of news that you see. And what this does is it makes people start judging people, thinking that everybody's either black or white. There is no gray. Fact is, everybody's gray. Nobody is black, or nobody's white. We are ready to get angry on people without thinking for a second because we're all angry because we want likes. I think the internet fundamentally changed the day retweets were invented, the day there were like buttons in the comment section of YouTube and Instagram, because that's it started giving people an incentive.",

    "whisperTranscription": "What? On Tinder? No, no, no. What were you talking about? Nothing. PUBG is good. You shouldn't say bad things about PUBG. PUBG is good and you make others play better? Yes, I teach everyone. What game are you talking about? Hey guys, welcome to the channel. A few days ago, Tanmay Singh aka Scout OP aka Fanatic Scout. I met him. I was lucky that I got to hang out with him for some time. We discussed a lot of things about PUBG and life. I had such a nice time hanging out with him because he was so kind and he was so nice. And one of the things that really struck me about him. When we talked about games, he was just so passionate. And he was so curious. And he was so generous to share everything he has learnt about playing professional esports. And I played a TDM game with him after which I obviously won. And despite beating him, he was just so nice. He just kept giving me tips and telling me tricks of how my game could improve. And I just really respect what a student of the game he is. And I want to say publicly, thank you Tanmay for giving me the time. I hope you guys enjoy the vlog. Tanmay, 1v1 TDM. Sure, done. Challenge? Who will win? You of course. Me? Scout is my brother. Scout brother. Anyone is Tanmay. Anyone? Okay. It's hard work. Once you get into PUBG, every game is different. The game is the same, the map is the same, the gun is the same, the people are the same. But in every game, every end is different. You will reach the same zone, but you won't be in the same house as you were in the last game. I want to know something. I have seen a lot of tournaments. I always want to know that when 4 people are sitting in a team. Yes. What are the conversations happening between them? Is it similar to what we hear on the stream? Or is it because the game strategies are different? How does IGL decide the rotation? It's a fact. In the Indian scene, people don't understand the role of IGL. In a team, there are support players, entry fraggers.",

It's a film made with a lot of love and it's been getting a lot of love, so watch it, Chittu Ka Birthday. This movie has blown my mind, but I'm also so jealous that I know them, they were friends and colleagues, now I'm a fan, that's how good this movie is. Go and watch the film, it was superb, it was amazing, amazing performances. I think one of the most heartwarming movies I've seen in recent times. Chintu is very cute, I don't know how to adopt him, I want to adopt him. Yeah, it was actually a lot of fun, it's very heartwarming and it's really nice. Like anything that comes out of the ARB production house had a lot of heart. We just watched Chintu Ka Birthday in writing and a great shot. It's very emotional. We had a lot of fun. Very happy, totally worth the hype. Excellent movie, yeah, great stuff, congratulations as well. All our voices put together, this film has to reach out to as many people as possible. This touches your heart in a way that you cannot imagine. Definite watch, please watch this movie. I think it is one of the most fantastic films we have made as an industry. Chintu Ka Birthday, it didn't shine here, it shined there. It's a great film, I really loved it, I really enjoyed watching it. Thanks AIB for bringing this story together. For me, the kids have done a fabulous job. Congrats to the directors who've done such a wonderful job. So I'm watching this film for the second time and I absolutely loved it, especially the acting.

Hey, talk to me! How long are you going to be shocked? Where are you, Alankrita? What do you do? I'm in 9th grade. You're in 9th standard? Yes, pretty fucked up. This is the language people in school talk like this? Alankrita, this is how you speak? I'm so sorry. What is this fucked up and all this bad words you're saying? Okay. What do you plan to study though in the future? I wanted to do medical before I understood how science looks like. It looks tough, no? Just do arts quietly. You won't be able to do science. Leave it. There's nothing in arts. Everybody is fucked up and everybody is just chilling. You don't have to do anything. There are very few hopes in life. And if sons and daughters would have done arts, their parents' hopes would have been fulfilled automatically. So what did you do? I took science. I'm giving you the wrong advice. I took science and I did biology for 2 years. Who gave the cell theory? Was it Vishwanathan Anand? Now next year, if you go and talk to any adult saying you want to do arts, they'll always say that you do science. Because once you do science, you can do anything after that. You can do arts after that also. Brown parent logic. My parents are like, you can do whatever you want but take science. You can do whatever you want inside science. Even inside science, I would say just stick to something with chemistry or physics. Actually, between chemistry and physics, ideally take chemistry. You can do anything in chemistry. I want to be a comedian. No, don't do that. Don't do that. I'm not going to be the reason why your parents throw you out of the house. I'm not going to take that.",
